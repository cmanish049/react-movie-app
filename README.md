# Project: react-basic

A modern web application built with React, Vite, and styled with Tailwind CSS. This project integrates with Appwrite for backend services.

## Features

- **React 19:** Leverages the latest features of React for a fast and interactive user interface.
- **Vite:** Next-generation frontend tooling for a significantly faster development experience.
- **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- **Appwrite:** Utilizes Appwrite for backend services, such as authentication, databases, and storage.
- **ESLint:** Integrated for code quality and consistency.

## Getting Started

- Node.js (v18 or newer)
- npm, yarn, or pnpm

### Appwrite Configuration

To connect to your Appwrite backend, you will need to create a configuration file or set environment variables with your Appwrite project ID and endpoint.
